Given an array of size N and a range [a, b]. The task is to partition the array around the range such that array is divided into three parts.
1) All elements smaller than a come first.
2) All elements in range a to b come next.
3) All elements greater than b appear in the end.
logic :
take 2 pointer (low and high) and iterate with i
if i is greater than range swap i value with high value and decrement high
if i if lesser than range then swap i value with low value and increment both (i is moving
to find next small element and small element which is pointing to mid value is waiting to
swap with next small value )
else increment only i
